## Superwars

Dustin and Lucus are best friends, they spend their weekends watching superhero series and playing superhero games. One Friday in school Mr.Hooper who is their computer science faculty member taught them HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. So what's next? It's Weekend! Lucus and Dustin will be on their laptops. Are they watching series or playing games? Lucus says, No we are building a new game.

Lucus always loves protagonists like most of us. But Dustin is quite crazy he likes antagonists. So now they are collecting a bunch of their favorite Super Heroes and Super-Villains names along with images. Did they tell you about the game that they are building? Uh no. Okay, lemme explain. They are going to facilitate the ultimate war between Super Heroes and Super-Villains. As they are new to these technologies, they need **YOU** to help them build this game.

## Learn CSS Flexbox and Grids

Milestone #1: As a first step we will build an arena and align the players against each other.

1. Create a html document `index.html`.
2. Using `CSS Grid`, create 3 columns one each for Heroes ,score and Villains in same order.
Note: Try to make it responsive and find the right size for each grid.
3. We need to add players to the left and right grids. Use the middle grid for the score.
4. Write CSS styles in `style.css`.


It should adhere to following conditions:
* Heroes on your left grid and Villains on the right grid.
* Heroes should be justified to the right and Villains to the left.
* Each player should have an image, name and strength(Number).
* Name and strength should be center aligned.
* Make the players equally spaced apart.

The final output should look like this
